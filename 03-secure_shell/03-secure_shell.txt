Introduction
------------

SSH has many advanced features like tunneling and X11 forwarding.

As the manual says, "the user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine
using one of several methods". One of these methods is the use of public-key
cryptography for authentication, password-less. Some obvious interests are
productivity and automation. We will practice that.  

If you don't know how asymmetric or public Key cryptography works, you should
find out. This could help you understand :

IMPORTANT: LAB 03-1 : public keys user authentication

We want to be able to connect securely and quickly to our virtual machine named 
lab.

Now that you found out about asymmetric cryptography, you know that we need a
pair of keys.

We will generate those keys and copy the public key in the target system in a
specific place. The private key should never be exposed.

To generate the keys with no passphrase and the default location, use :
[source,sh]
ssh-keygen -q -t dsa -C '' -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa

You should find the public and private keys in `~/.ssh`

Then copy the pub key in the proper location on your target system. There is a 
helper tool for this.

[source,sh]
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_dsa.pub bob@lab

Now try logging into the machine again.

With selinux in mode enforcing, you might need to restore a context on the
target system :

[source,sh]
/sbin/restorecon -v ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


IMPORTANT: LAB 03-2 : X11 forwarding

You can use graphical tools and applications working on a remote system without
installing any display server there.

You can export or forward the display to your local display server.

With `ssh -X` you can do a X11 forwarding.

On your local system, check in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` :
[source,conf]
ForwardX11 yes

On your remote system named lab, check in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` :
[source,conf]
X11Forwarding yes

Restart the service sshd if you needed to change the configuration.

On your remote system, you also need to install xauth :
[source,sh]
yum -y install xauth

And here is a little graphical program to test :
[source,sh]
yum -y install xeyes

Note that all the dependencies are client display libraries, not server 
libraries.

Finally, test the X11 forwarding :
[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ssh -X bob@lab xeyes &
ps aux | grep xeyes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now kill the program.
